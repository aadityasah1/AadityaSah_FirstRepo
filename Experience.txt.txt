The first month of college can be both exciting and challenging, as you adjust to a new environment, meet new people, and explore new opportunities. I join many societies,club, activities that match my interests and skills.The first month of college is a crucial time to make a good impression on our professors,classmates,and seniors. I can do this by attending classes regularly,participating actively,completing my work on time, and being respectful and friwwndly to everyone. The first month of college is also a great opportunity to discover myself and my potential. I can experiment with different courses, subject, or majors, learn new skills or hobbies, and challenge myself to step out of my comfort zone. I also played more sports,attending orientation of many club and learn more things  from seniors.

Now come to fresher party which is 'Nebula' is the freshers' festival of IIT Patna ,which is organized by the House of Socio-Cultural Affairs(HoSCA) to welcome the new students and introduce them to the cultural activities of the institute. Nebula offers a variety of events,such as band perfomance, classical dance, comedy show, fashion walk, and Mr & Miss Nebula contest. This event gave a great opportunity for the freshers to showcase their talents, make new friends, and have fun.

In last i really enjoy the first month of college and hope this will be going well.
